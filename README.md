### Hello, human! :alien:

Greetings from outer space! I'm a graphic designer with a passion for discovering how things work. I love to study! **#nerdalert**

Besides working as a designer for the past 11 years (God, time flies!), I'm also a craftswoman, visual artist, seamstress, set designer, and programming student. I can't stand still, and I'm always learning something new. 

I'm currently learning Django and JavaScript (I still don't know which JS framework to choose). I love HTML and CSS. My first experience with them was when I was a teenager and loved to create templates for my blogspot (mainly InuYasha templates haha). 

I also know a lot about WordPress. My first WordPress website was developed in 2012. I learned a lot about databases and PHP back then. I honestly found it boring, because my real passion lies in Front-end, UX, and UI (once a designer, always a designer :heart_eyes_cat:). 

I'm a kinesthetic learner, so most of the courses don't work for me. I'm easily distracted in lectures, and can't remember anything unless it's a hands-on approach. I dream of a future in which is easy to find schools with different approaches to learning. Unfortunately, the present is still hard for someone like me.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the real world! I quit social media a few years ago and it has been an amazing experience! 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: let's exchange long and dramatic letters! My e-mail is dandara.bayer@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: they/them 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I produced my first fashion show at the age of 5. I designed the whole program, with pictures of the dresses and texts about the inspiration in Greek mythology. My grandmother and brother were the audience, and all the clothes were assembled with sheets. A natural-born artist! haha
